## Project Insight
The HR Attrition Dashboard provides key insights into employee attrition to help improve retention strategies:

-Overall Attrition Rate: 34% of employees left, with 66% still active.
-Gender Analysis: Male attrition is higher (65%) compared to female (35%).
-Age Group: The 26-35 age group shows the highest attrition (32 employees).
-Job Role: Highest attrition occurs among Laboratory Technicians (26) and Sales Executives (20).
-Department: R&D faces the most attrition (72%), indicating a need for intervention.
-Performance: 79 high-performing employees left, a concern for business productivity.
-Education: Bachelor’s and Master’s degree holders have the highest attrition.
-Business Travel: Employees who travel rarely (76) leave more often than frequent travelers.
-Work Distance: Surprisingly, most attrition comes from employees living near the workplace.

-Recommendation: Focus on reducing attrition in the R&D department, retaining high performers, and improving engagement for the 26-35 age group.

## Conclusion
-The HR Attrition Dashboard reveals high attrition among male employees, the 26-35 age group, and key roles like Laboratory Technicians. The R&D department faces the highest turnover, requiring immediate attention. To reduce attrition, the company should focus on improving conditions in R&D, engaging mid-career professionals, and retaining high performers through incentives and development opportunities.

-This dashboard is a valuable tool for making data-driven decisions to improve employee retention and satisfaction.
